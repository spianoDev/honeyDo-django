# honeyDo-django
### A fully developed Python/Django application deployed on Heroku.

![Styled Landing Page]() 

## conception
This application is a fanciful take on the idea of the 'Honey Do' lists. My household thrives on these nearly daily task lists to keep us running smoothly. I wanted a simple interface that both kids and adults could use. 

## technologies used
<ul>
<li>Django</li>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>  
</ul>

Visit [HoneyDo-Django](https://honeydo-app.herokuapp.com/) to experience the live application and feel free to browse my other applications on my [website](https://spiano.dev).

## future uses
My intention is to create multiple versions of this application using a variety of technologies. This version uses only the backend technologies listed, but I should be able to get identicle results with an Express backend build, or a React front end.
